# Issue tracker

Used by me to track tech questions I have.

I prefer this to Q/A sites because they may edit or delete questions. I can still crosspost them, but this way I can keep the originals online as well.

It's also better than timeline based sites like twitter because they stay prominent in the UI until I close them.
