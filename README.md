# About

Issue tracker for my questions about tech.

(The actual repo just contains random snippets.)

# Why

Q/A sites edit and delete questions. I may crosspost to them, but I want a place to keep the originals.

Timeline sites bury questions. I want a place where they stay up until I close them.
